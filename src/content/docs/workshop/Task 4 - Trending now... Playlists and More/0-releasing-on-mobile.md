## Release Mobile Apps On Your Terms

Not having a mobile app for your business has certainly become the expection, not the rule. As a result, mobile development is increasingly becoming a more critical function within an organization. Unfortunately, the mobile development process itself doesn't always lend itself to rapid development and innovation. Waiting on app store approvals for new releases, bug fixes, or any customizations in your application can slow innovation down to a crawl. 

With LaunchDarkly, mobile developers can: 
* **Release features on their own terms and timelines** 
* **Mitigate bugs without app store approvals** 
* **Improve the in-app experience for every audience**

LaunchDarkly wants to help your mobile developers take back the application lifecycle and make release follow their schedule, not the app store's.

## Toggles On the Go
As you might have guessed, Toggle Outfitters is well aware of the mobile trend. They want folks to be able to purchase Toggles and Goggles anywhere, at anytime. While this might be the first mobile app that you're getting hands on with, you know LaunchDarkly is going to be there with you every step of the way!
