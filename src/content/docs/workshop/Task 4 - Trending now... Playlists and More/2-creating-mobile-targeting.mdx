title: Targeting Mobile Attributes
---

## Using What We Know
We've now set up our mobile application to automatically send us all the default values from the device that is accessing our mobile application. With that it place, it's time to utilize this information. First, we'll follow a similar pattern that we have before, targeting!  

## Step 1: Reading the Attributes
So now that we have our attributes being collected, what exactly are we receiving when the SDK initalizes. There are two context kinds that are sent to LaunchDarkly when the automatic environment attributes have been enabled: 

* `ld_application`: Information about the application itself including: version, name, unique identifier, and locale of the device. 
* `ld_device`: Information about the device the application is running on, including: manufacturer, model, and operating system. 

Using this information, we can create targeting rules like we did previously, but rather than using our segments or individual rules, we're going to select **Target Mobile** on our flag:

## Step 2: Creating the Rule
This step is going to feel very familiar at this point. We've created targeting rules in the past, but this time we're going to do something a bit different. Go into the `1 - Release Toggle Outfitters Updated Storefront` flag. Delete any existing rules and save the changes. You'll now see the "Quick Start" options shown above. 

### Validating our Application

The last thing we want is to create a rule that isn't going to be enforced when our application gets released. Fortunately, LaunchDarkly inspects this for you. When you select that **Target Mobile** option. You'll see a screen like this:

LaunchDarkly is actively inspecting if this flag is being evaluated by a mobile device and has been configured to retrieve the environment attributes we discussed before. If these are not checked off, we can't move forward with this type of targeting rule and you can simply click, "I'll do this later." If you need help, both of these options are hyperlinked to our documentation.

### Adding targets 
Once both requirements have been satisfied, we can move forward with our rule creation. After selecting the **Target Mobile** option, you'll see a rule populated automatically with three context attributes: `ID`, `Version`, and `OS name`.

The Toggle Outfitters team is planning to launch their iOS version of the store front before their Android one. So we can remove the `application` rules for now set the value of `manufacturer` as `Apple` and enable the web store. It will look something like this:

Unfortunately, Toggle Outfitters is still in the approval process, they didn't start using LaunchDarkly fast enough, so while we cannot show the live version of this, here are a couple of screenshots from our mobile simulators:

### Android Device

This is what each of our users would see if they downloaded the latest version of Toggle Outfitters Mobile! Pretty neat to be able to restrict access to a feature based on the device accessing it right? Well we can go even further with LaunchDarkly, like determining when an application version is ready for deprecation.
