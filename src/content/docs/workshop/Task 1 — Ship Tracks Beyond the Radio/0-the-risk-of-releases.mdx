# Say Goodbye to Slow, Unstable Releases

Developers struggle to increase the velocity and stability of software releases for customers without the fear of negative customer experiences. You know the drill. Everyone is complaining inside of your organization about how long it takes to ship improvements to applications, but you have to test in the 3 lower environments. If you don't and something goes wrong, it's going to be a really rough day (or 2am outage call!).

Releases don't have to be like this! LaunchDarkly lets developers:

- **Release features progressively and roll back instantly**
- **Control the impact radius of every feature release**
- **Safely migrate and modernize your tech stack**

Using LaunchDarkly, we separate deployments from releases, helping us move faster, with less risk. But how? Well that's where you come in...

## Congratulations! Today is your first day!

You recently joined the Toggle Outfitters team as a new developer. Toggle Outfitters is a retailer looking to expand their online capabilities to better meet the needs of their growing customer base. They recently adopted LaunchDarkly to help them accelerate the way they develop, ship and release software.

Your first task is to help the team release a brand new e-commerce experience for their business. A lot of pressure for your first day right? Not a problem! Since you have LaunchDarkly supporting you in this release, we can deploy code safely and quickly. Let's get started!

## What You'll Learn
