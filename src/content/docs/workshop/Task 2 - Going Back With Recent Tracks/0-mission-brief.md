# Time to Hit Our Target

Wow, for your first day here at Toggle Outfitters, you're making a big splash already! Thanks to all your hard work in launching the new digital storefront and the modernization to make it possible to serve toggles at scale, Toggle Outfitters has had **remarkable** success. 

In fact, we've been so successful in selling Toggles, we're ready to expand into new markets with a new product line, Goggles. The competition in the goggles market is stiff. Goggles Outfitters has cornered the market and we want a slice of that goggle action! 

We want to be deliberate with this release, fortunately with LaunchDarkly you can:
* **Target based on what you know**
* **Drive better customer engagement**
* **Let business teams control their audiences**

### Now it's your turn

Targeting is complicated business and the timeline is tight. We can't afford long testing cycles or we'll miss our window to enter this market. If we have to code this targeting logic ourselves, we'll never make it. Let's launch our new line of Goggles, but being careful to roll them out only to users in permitted regions and to our internal team for testing.

### What You'll Learn
At the end of this module you'll have gained the following experience:  

* Use feature flags for entitlement programs
* Retrieve new product data for specific users
* Create targeting rules for regional rollouts 
* Gain a better understanding of LaunchDarkly custom contexts
