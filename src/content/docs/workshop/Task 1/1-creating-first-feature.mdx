## Release the New Player Without the Risk!


DJ Toggle wants to give power back to the users! They want to enable a new track selector that allows users to select the songs they want to hear. Previously it would take weeks to ship a new version of ToggleTunes. 
Now, with the help of LaunchDarkly, new features can go live almost instantly, and be rolled back just as fast, heaven forbid something goes wrong.  

No new installs. No big reloads. Let’s get ship done! 

### Objective: Create the project’s first feature flag in LaunchDarkly


Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `create flag`, choose the `Release` option and then follow these steps:

<img src='/src/assets/img/createFlag.png' />

### Creating your first flag

<img src='/src/assets/img/releaseTracklist.png' />

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
    Flag Name:{" "}
  </span>
    <CopyField value="release-tracklist" client:load />
</div>
<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">Flag Key:</span>
  <CopyField value="release-tracklist" client:load />
</div>

### Flag Variations

<img src='/src/assets/img/releaseFlag.png' />

Select the `Boolean` option and fill in the variations with this information:

<div className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">
Default variations:{" "}
<span className="text-black dark:text-white font-normal">Set to serve 'Available' when targeting is ON</span>
</div>

Turn on targeting to enable the new features and see the changes within the ToggleTunes interface!

You're on the board! The new track selector is live in less than 200ms!
