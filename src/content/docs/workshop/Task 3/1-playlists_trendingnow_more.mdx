## Shipping New Playlists and Trending Hits!
With all these new tracks, our users want to have access to curated playlists as well as improved discovery features helping them discover the hottest new tracks. Our brilliant team developed the very advanced ToggleAI, enabling users to access curated playlists and new discovery features.

Let's ship these features, and keep the good vibes rollin'.

### Creating a New Segment

Before creating your flags, create a new segment by selecting **'Create Segment'**. Select **'Build Dynamic Conditions and Rules'**

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
    Segment Name:{" "}
  </span>
    <CopyField value="Platinum Users" client:load />
</div>

Once the segment is saved, select **'Add Rule'** and select **'Custom'**. Add the attribute of "tier" and then, in the Operator dropdown, choose **'is one of'** and enter **'Platinum'** for the value. Save your selection and move on to the next step.

With this feature enabled, we have revolutionized how our users curate and discover their sick beats. Playlists, trending hits, and our recent tunes are all at our user's fingertips.

No downtime, no risks — just good vibes and launches.

Now, we're ready to target our users.

This feature will be toggled “off” for most of our users.  However, the “Platinum User” segment we set up in a previous set will be able to access these experiences by targeting these users specifically upon release.

### Targeting Specific Users

On the flag details page for our new flag, select **'Target Segments'**, and within the segment rules, select our **'Platinum Users'** segment.

Ensure the serve section is set to **'Available'** enable the feature and save the changes. Finally, turn the flag to on.

With our toggle and serve section set to “Available” and our segments targeted correctly, Platinum users receive product access to our exclusive experiences. Bonus points for not breaking a sweat or writing a single line of code in the process.

ToggleTunes VIPs now enjoy the perks of DJ Toggle's concert and new ToggleTunes audio books — soon, we'll be able to launch tickets to the upcoming Jen Velocity “Ages” tour - an experience that's proven impossible to get tickets to!
