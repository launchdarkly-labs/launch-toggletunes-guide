## Shipping NEW UI Layout with Playlists and Trending Hits in a Safer Manner!

Our users want to have access to curated playlists as well as improved discovery features helping them discover the hottest new tracks. Our brilliant team developed the very advanced ToggleAI, enabling users to access curated playlists and new discovery features.

We want to avoid releasing a broken feature again to everyone, so we want our Developers to only see the new feature for testing purposes.

Let's ship these features, and keep the good vibes rollin'.

### Objective\: New Feature Flag
Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `create flag`, choose the `Release` option and then follow these steps:

### Flag Variations

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
    Flag Name:{" "}
  </span>
    <CopyField value="release-new-users-playlist" client:load />
</div>

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">Flag Key:</span>
  <CopyField value="release-new-users-playlist" client:load />
</div>

<img src='/src/assets/img/releaseFlag.png' />

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
     Default Rule{" "}
  </span>
  when "On" is "Unavailable"
</div>

Now, we're ready to target our Developers.

This feature will be toggled “off” for most of our users.  However, our Developers will be able to access these experiences by targeting these users specifically upon release.

### Targeting Only Internal Developer to Test New UI Feature in Production

On the flag details page for our new flag, under **'Rules'** section, click on the dropdown **'Add rule'**, and within the Add rule, select our **'Build a custom rule'** segment.

<img src='/src/assets/img/developerTarget.png' />

Copy what you see in the image above. 

Here is the rule: Context kind **'user'**, Attribute  **'role'**, Operator **'is one of '**, Values **'Developer'**.

Roll out **'Available'** for **'Developer'** ONLY. 


**'Default Rule'** should be  **'Unavailable'**. This will allow your Developer to only see the new UI.

Save the changes. Finally, turn the flag to **'On'** .


In the upper right hand corner,  **'Click on the picture'** to switch users.

<img src='/src/assets/img/newUIStandardUser.png' />

<img src='/src/assets/img/newUIDeveloperOnly.png' />

With our toggle and serve section set to “Available” and our Developer targeted correctly, Developer can see the new UI feature and test the feature in production. Bonus points for not breaking a sweat or writing a single line of code in the process.
