# Release the ToggleBeats Backend!

The updated player is a hit and our users want MORE – more tracks, more album art, and more features to show them off! The ToggleTunes dev team moved this rich data to a scalable database. Instead of waiting 3 months for new beats to drop (mega lame), we can migrate our backend using the power of LaunchDarkly's Migration flags.

### Objective\: Create a Migration Feature Flag

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `create flag`, choose the `Migration` option and then follow these steps:

### FlaTask 5 - Releasing Features at Platinum Tierg Variations

<div className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">
  Flag Name:{" "}
  <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-normal">
    ToggleBeats DB Migration
  </span>
</div>

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">Flag Key:</span>
  <CopyField value="newtoggledb" client:load />
</div>

<div className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">
  Number of Stages:{" "}
  <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-normal">
    2 Stages
  </span>
</div>

For this feature flag, be sure to edit the cohort settings. Cohort settings enable you to target a specific audience or audience segment.

Today, we will be using the cohort settings to select which groups to apply the “complete” migration step to.  ToggleTunes is for everyone  — let’s go ahead and select 100% of users.

Save, release, then let the beats drop! Our users migrate seamlessly over to the ToggleBeats API and database instantly. The new music and album art is now available for all.
