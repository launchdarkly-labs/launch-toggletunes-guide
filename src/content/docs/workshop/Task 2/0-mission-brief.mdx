## Launching our Latest Feature - Playlist History

Users want the ability to select from previous tracks they've heard.  

The developers have already prepped the code and it's ready, but we don't need to wait for the pipeline. Let's create our new feature, and release it to the users!

### Objective\: Another minute, another launch â€” Create another feature flag!

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `create flag`, choose the `Release` option and then follow these steps:

### Flag Variations

Select the `Boolean` option and fill in the variations with this information:
<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
    Flag Name:{" "}
  </span>
    <CopyField value="recenttunes" client:load />
</div>

<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">Flag Key:</span>
  <CopyField value="recenttunes" client:load />
</div>

<div className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">
Default variations:{" "}
<span className="text-black dark:text-white font-normal">Set to serve 'Available' when targeting is ON</span>

</div>

Once this is complete, turn on targeting. Flip back to the site and refresh to check out the brand-new navigation system! 

Task two conquered. ðŸ˜Ž
